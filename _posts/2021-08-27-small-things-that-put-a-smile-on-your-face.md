title: Small things that put a smile on your face
---

One good thing from the lockdown from me is that I have more opportunity to reflect on small things happening around me because of limited space and interaction. One thing that will put a smile on my face and I look forward to every morning is when Bethany and Gabriel woke up and rushing out of bedroom while I am normally at the outside :)
